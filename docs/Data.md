## UCF101

We test the code with UCF-101 dataset. In order to download UCF-101 dataset, you can download the necessary files in [here](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php). The code assumes a `ucf101` directory with the following structure
```
UCF-101/
    ApplyEyeMakeup/
        v1.avi
        ...
    ...
    YoYo/
        v1.avi
        ...
```
